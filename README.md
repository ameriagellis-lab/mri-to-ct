# MRI to CT Conversion Project

This repository contains:
- A MATLAB program that trains a neural network to convert MRI images into CT images.
- A simple HTML webpage that allows users to select an MRI file and send it to a backend for conversion.
- A frontend interface designed to work with any future API at the endpoint `/convert`.

> **Important:**  
> This repository does not include a backend server.  
> The HTML file shows the correct user interface, but the conversion button will only work when connected to an API located at:  
> **POST /convert**
